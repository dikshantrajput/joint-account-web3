JOINT ACCOUNTS IN WEB3.0

Intro:
joint account -> more than one member is the owner of that account and can send transactions to another person or do something with the money they together saved or collected.

NOTE:There will be separate accounts but all the tx will be happening when a proposal gets a certain number of votes.

### Flow:
* Submitting a proposal
* Getting approved by majority
* Executing the tx 

There will be a one day lapse between the proposal and execution. This is done to keep the system fair and anyone can revoke their approval anytime before the execution.


In case of withdrawal (pass data in proposal as withdrawal), it will also happen with the help of proposals and every holder will get equal amount specified.


### Improvements:
* UI
* Implementation of backend for storing events and every other data for optimizations
